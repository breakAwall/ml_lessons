### File Descriptions
proposal.pdf/proposal.docx: This includes the pdf and docx respectively of the proposal I had submitted for the capstone earlier
report.pdf/report.docx: the report.pdf is the main file, containing my report. It has descriptions and images for the motivation, background, data exploration, model selection, preprocessing, model evaluation, etc.
data_exploration_raw.ipynb: This was the first file I wrote, it isn't well formatted data exploration
data_exploration.ipynb: This is my 'official' data exploration file, it is clean, documented, and structured and has information on all the data exploration steps I did and included in my report. 
feature_creation.ipynb: This file contains code that did any variable selection and preprocessing to create the input and output I would eventually feed into my models. It also has code that runs the benchmark. 
model_selection.ipynb: This file contains models that were ultimately selected for presentation in the report. All these models were run on sagemaker.
selected_model_eval.ipynb: This file contains code for running cross validation on teh selected model as well as analyzing its output in terms of what it got right and wrong.
